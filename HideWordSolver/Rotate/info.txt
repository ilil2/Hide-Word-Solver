Rotate :

	Step 1:
		- Make a "make"
		
	Step 2:
		- Do a "./rotation <image_path> <rotation_type> [angle]"
			- Image_path represents the image to be used for our examples.
				examples, we'll use "assets/image_rotation.png".
			- Rotation_type is the type of rotation, which is either automatic with "auto"
				or manual
			- Angle represents, if manual rotation is chosen,
				the angle in degrees to rotate the image
		- All commands have errors that explain if an argument is missing, etc,
			Try it, it's safe

	Step 3:
		- If there are no errors, the image is displayed rotated,
			then just close the window
	
	Step 4:
		- make clean
